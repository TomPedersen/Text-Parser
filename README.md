Small program to find various characteristics of any given item of text. This will allow you to find such things like:

- The number of sentences contained within the text.
- The number of words contained within the text.
- The sentence with the most words in it.
- The most frequently used word(s) in the text.
- The 3rd longest word(s) in the text.

As time goes on I might add other cool things to it.
