Write a program that parses a text file and produces the following information.
1.	The number of sentences contained within the text.
2.	The number of words contained within the text.
3.	The sentence with the most words in it.
4.	The most frequently used word(s) in the text.
5.	The 3rd longest word(s) in the text.

* Regex replace to take out punctuation. Keep .!? to specify end of sentences.
1. Sentence defined as string split by '.' or '!' or '?' --> .Length for number of sentences 
2. Word defined as string, split by ' ' --> .Length for number of words. Remove sentence terminators first so they don't add to word length
3. Find largest sentence by regex split function, then lambda to sort by descending, then LINQ to grab and return the first. In this case punctuation shouldn't matter
4. GroupBy, sorted with LINQ, then sorted by descending. Return first key.
5. Sort by descending first, then groupby string length with LINQ, skip 2, return first + key for char#
